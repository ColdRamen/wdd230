                White space is basically the opposite of clutter. A website with good design will spread content out appropriately and apply
                the principle of "less is more." Google applies this design by displaying the right amount of information in the right place.
                The absence of clutter allows users to easily see and use the search bar, which is Google's purpose.

                Choosing how to align content is an important decision, and Area17 does this well by using heavy left-alignment. Even their logo
                is left-aligned, and the only thing not aligned to the left is the menu. The contrast of left and right draws your eye down the
                page, yet the page menu is distinct and easy to see.

                Fitt's law is all about positioning of elements and how easy they are to reach, or in the case of mobile browsing, the effort
