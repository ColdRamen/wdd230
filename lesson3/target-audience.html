        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>
            The target audience for the Logan City Chamber of Commerce website will primarily be business owners. From this group, there will
            be a wide range when it comes to size of businesses. Besides business owners, there will likely be executive staff representing their
            business, though they might not be considered its "owner". These visitors will have varying education levels, but will most likely
            have some post-secondary education experience. Their ages will range from 25 to 60.
